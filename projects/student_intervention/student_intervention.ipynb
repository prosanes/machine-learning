In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "    - It's final result can easily be interpreted by humans. It performs well when the data entropy can be lowered as we split the data in two.\n",
    "    - It can perform poorly when we have a lot of features that leads to a complicated tree that overfits the data. It is also a NP-Complete problem, meaning it can be really slow to train\n",

    "    - Doesnt perform well when there are a large amount of data to train on, since it has a cubic complexity.\n",
    "    - Since there's only 395 samples in our data, I believe SVM can be a good candidate.\n",
