    "### Project Overview\n",
    "<!-- In this section, look to provide a high-level overview of the project in layman’s terms. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Has an overview of the project been provided, such as the problem domain, project origin, and related datasets or input data?_\n",
    "- _Has enough background information been given so that an uninformed reader would understand the problem domain and following problem statement?_\n",

    "\n",
    "[Kaggle's](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-trip-type-classification) Walmart Recruiting: Trip Type Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Walmart uses both art and science to continually make progress on their core mission of better understanding and serving their customers. One way Walmart is able to improve customers' shopping experiences is by segmenting their store visits into different trip types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether they're on a last minute run for new puppy supplies or leisurely making their way through a weekly grocery list, classifying trip types enables Walmart to create the best shopping experience for every customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Walmart's trip types are created from a combination of existing customer insights (\"art\") and purchase history data (\"science\"). In this recruiting competition, Walmart is challenging Kagglers to focus on the (data) science and classify customer trips using only a transactional dataset of the items they've purchased. Improving the science behind trip type classification will help Walmart refine their segmentation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "In this section, you will want to clearly define the problem that you are trying to solve, including the strategy (outline of tasks) you will use to achieve the desired solution. You should also thoroughly discuss what the intended solution will be for this problem. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Is the problem statement clearly defined? Will the reader understand what you are expecting to solve?_\n",
    "- _Have you thoroughly discussed how you will attempt to solve the problem?_\n",
    "- _Is an anticipated solution clearly defined? Will the reader understand what results you are looking for?_\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to classify shopping trip types based on the items that customers purchased. To give a few hypothetical examples of trip types: a customer may make a small daily dinner trip, a weekly large grocery trip, a trip to buy gifts for an upcoming holiday, or a seasonal trip to buy clothes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Walmart has categorized the trips contained in this data into 38 distinct types using a proprietary method applied to an extended set of data. The challange is to recreate this categorization/clustering with a more limited set of features. This could provide new and more robust ways to categorize trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasets and Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is provided by Walmart in the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-trip-type-classification/data). The set contains many different Trip informations, including information about the day it happened and information about the bought products. Each line of the CSV represents an bought item and some meta-information about the trip. Bellow you can find the detailed description of each information:\n",
    "- *TripType* - a categorical id representing the type of shopping trip the customer made. This is the ground truth that you are predicting. TripType_999 is an \"other\" category.\n",
    "- *VisitNumber* - an id corresponding to a single trip by a single customer\n",
    "- *Weekday* - the weekday of the trip\n",
    "- *Upc* - the UPC number of the product purchased\n",
    "- *ScanCount* - the number of the given item that was purchased. A negative value indicates a product return.\n",
    "- *DepartmentDescription* - a high-level description of the item's department\n",
    "- *FinelineNumber* - a more refined category for each of the products, created by Walmart\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intended Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended solution for this problem is primarily the highest output of a probabilistic Multi-class SVM Classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reasons for such a selection is due to the following facts:\n",
    "- Since SVM uses the concept of largest margin of separtion, there is no possible local minima.\n",
    "- The ability to choose different kernels give this algorithm a desired flexibility\n",
    "- Stochastic Dradient Descent makes it a efficient algorithm to train\n",
    "- Flexibility of parameters choice\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of the project is to understand the data quantitatively. For that a counting of how many different classes, department descriptions and fineline numbers and products (UPCs) there are in the train set will be done. Also, there will be a description of the distribution of scan count. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input files must also be parsed to better fit the problem description. That is, each line of the file should be merged into a single data structure that represent a trip. That way, queries about a trip can be easily done. During that step, lines with missing data can also be handled, and new features created. For example, suppose a line of the input file misses values for Department, Fineline Number and Upc, that line can still be used to count the total amount of products for the trip. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the data is structured by trip and not by product purchase, I will be able to describe the distribution of department description and fineline numbers by trip, and check the correlation between each department and each fineline number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next step, I will execute some unsupervised learning algorithms such as Gaussian Mixture Model and KMeans. K can be varied from the number of trip types defined in the train data to higher number, since there is a trip type with name \"Others\". Suggesting that in reallity there are more trip types then the ones provided by Walmart. Dimensionality reduction might also be used to better visualize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all the analyzes have been done, I'll train a Support Vector Machine with Stochastic Gradient Descent given the size of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "In this section, you will need to clearly define the metrics or calculations you will use to measure performance of a model or result in your project. These calculations and metrics should be justified based on the characteristics of the problem and problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Are the metrics you’ve chosen to measure the performance of your models clearly discussed and defined?_\n",
    "- _Have you provided reasonable justification for the metrics chosen based on the problem and solution?_\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "A multi-class logarithmic loss function will be used to evaluate the model. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{j=1}^My_{ij}\\log(p_{ij}),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of visits in the test set, $M$ is the number of trip types, log is the natural logarithm, $y_{ij}$ is 1 if observation $i$ is of class $j$ and 0 otherwise, and $p_{ij}$ is the predicted probability that observation $i$ belongs to class $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are replaced with max(min(p,1-10^{-15}),10^{-15}).\n"

The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment).
